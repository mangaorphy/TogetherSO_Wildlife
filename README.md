# TogetherSO Wildlife Protection System

## Global ViBE: AI CODING HACKATHON

## The Problem

Protected areas worldwide face a critical threat from illegal poaching activities, which has become one of the major challenges in wildlife conservation. Traditional monitoring methods are:
- **Limited in coverage**: Rangers cannot patrol vast areas simultaneously
- **Reactive rather than proactive**: Discovery of poaching often happens after the damage is done
- **Resource-intensive**: Requires significant manpower and funding
- **Time-delayed**: By the time rangers respond, poachers have often fled the scene

The lack of real-time threat detection puts endangered species at risk and makes it difficult to apprehend perpetrators.

## The Solution: TogetherSO

TogetherSO is an AI-powered anti-poaching system that leverages IoT technology to create a comprehensive, real-time wildlife protection network.

### How It Works

**1. Intelligent Sound Detection**
- AI models trained to identify sounds associated with poaching activities:
  - Gunshots
  - Dog barks
  - Vehicle noises
  - Human voices
  - Animal distress calls (specifically guinea fowl alarm calls)

**2. IoT Sensor Network**
- Network of IoT devices equipped with microphones deployed throughout protected areas
- Continuous 24/7 environmental monitoring
- Wide coverage across vast conservation zones

**3. Real-Time Alert System**
- Immediate notifications sent to park rangers and conservation authorities
- Multi-channel alerts via mobile app and SMS
- Location-specific threat information for rapid response

### Key Benefits

**Proactive Protection**: Detect threats as they happen, not after  
**Rapid Response**: Enable quick ranger deployment to prevent wildlife harm
**Increased Coverage**: Monitor large areas simultaneously without additional manpower  
**Higher Success Rate**: Improve chances of apprehending poachers in the act  
**Deterrent Effect**: Create a network that makes poaching significantly riskier
